Installation
============

Cellsnp-lite depends on several external libraries such as htslib_.
We highly recommend installing cellsnp-lite via conda_ to avoid potential
issues regarding dependency.

Install via conda (latest stable version)
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c bioconda cellsnp-lite


Alternatively, you may also compile from source code.


Install from this Github Repo (latest stable/dev version)
---------------------------------------------------------

Step 0: install dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cellsnp-lite mainly depends on `zlib`_ and `HTSlib`_ (v1.10.2+). 
Note that HTSlib has some extra dependencies: ``liblzma``, ``libbz2``, 
``libcurl``, and ``libcrypto``. 
The whole list of dependencies of building cellsnp-lite is:

* gcc (have tested v4.8.5 on CentOS 7)
* autoreconf
* zlib
* HTSlib >= 1.10.2
* liblzma
* libbz2
* libcurl
* libcrypto

All dependencies should have been installed into the system before installing 
cellsnp-lite.

If you already have a pre-installed HTSlib then go to next step. 
Otherwise, a common way to install HTSlib is building from its Github repo 
following this `HTSlib instruction`_.
When HTSlib is successfully installed, there should be some executable files 
(e.g., ``bgzip``) and library files (e.g., ``libhts.a`` and ``libhts.so``) in 
htslib dir.

Step 1: compiling cellsnp-lite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once all dependencies have been installed, it's ready to compile cellsnp-lite,

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite.git
  cd cellsnp-lite
  autoreconf -iv
  ./configure     # Needed for choosing optional functionality
  make
  
  make install    # Optional, may need sudo privilege

By default, this will either build against a pre-installed HTSlib in 
``../htslib`` or build with a HTSlib in a system library path (e.g., 
``/usr/lib``). 
You can alter this to a pre-installed HTSlib elsewhere by configuring with 
``--with-htslib=DIR``.
The ``DIR`` should be either a dir containing a source tree with 
``libhts.a``/``libhts.so`` being in ``DIR``, or a dir containing ``include`` 
and ``lib`` subdirs with ``libhts.a``/``libhts.so`` being in ``DIR/lib``. 
Note that ``DIR`` must be absolute path and please use ``/home/<user>`` 
instead of ``~`` if needed.


Possible issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix the issue "error while loading shared libraries: libhts.so.3"
*****************************************************************
Compilation in Step 1 prefers ``libhts.a`` than ``libhts.so`` for linking 
HTSlib. 
In rare cases that the ``libhts.a`` does not exist and ``libhts.so`` has to be
used for linking, the issue 
``error while loading shared libraries: libhts.so.3`` could happen when 
running cellsnp-lite, if HTSlib is not in system library path (e.g., 
``/usr/lib``).

The issue, if happened, could be fixed by adding abspath to the dir containing
``libhts.so`` to the environment variable ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``,

.. code-block:: bash

  echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<abspath_to_htslib_dir>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
